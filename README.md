# MSDS 6306: Doing Data Science - Case Study 01

## Team Members
- Garrett Shankel
- Duy Nguyen

### Purpose of Our Project
The CEO and CFO of a major brewing company have provided our team with a dataset for nationwide statistics of beers and breweries. Our job as data scientists are to perform a thorough investigation into this data. 

Things we have found include but are not limited to: 
- Outlining the data through graphical means
- Mapping the correlations between ABV and IBU
- Investigating the brewery density per state

To cap off the investigation, we took an in-depth look into the distributions of the top 10 beers styles to provide an incentive for market expansion.
